# Hotel Booking Trends Analysis
# Overview
This repository contains an in-depth analysis of hotel booking trends, focusing on predicting customer reservation honoring. The project utilizes a comprehensive dataset of hotel bookings to explore various factors influencing customer behavior in the hospitality industry.

# Contents
Hotel_Case_Study_Modified (1).ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the data analysis process, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning model development.
Hotel Case Study Report.pdf: A detailed report summarizing the findings, methodologies, and insights from the analysis, including visualizations and model evaluation metrics.
Key Highlights
Data Preprocessing: Detailed preprocessing steps, including label encoding, feature scaling, and handling categorical and numerical data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Investigation of data patterns, relationships, and booking trends using various statistical analyses and visualizations.
Machine Learning Models: Implementation and evaluation of Decision Tree and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) models to predict booking status, both pre- and post-application of Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE).
Model Evaluation: Detailed assessment of model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-scores, along with confusion matrices.
Insights and Implications: Analysis of the impact of class imbalance on model performance and the trade-offs between balanced class prediction and overall accuracy.
Installation and Usage
To run the Jupyter Notebook locally, ensure you have Python installed along with the following libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy, and scikit-learn. Clone the repository and install the required packages using pip install -r requirements.txt.
